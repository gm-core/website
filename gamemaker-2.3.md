# GameMaker 2.3

GM Core is and will be designed moving forward to best fit use in GameMaker 2.3. As such, it will make use of newer features only found in 2.3+ such as method variables.

You can still use older releases found in every GM Core Github repository if you need support for older versions of GameMaker: Studio. Each package will specify which release is the offical 2.3+ release.
