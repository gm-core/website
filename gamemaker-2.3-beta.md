# GameMaker 2.3 Beta

In late April 2020, YoYo Games announced the [GameMaker Studio 2.3 Beta](https://www.yoyogames.com/blog/565/gamemaker-studio-2-version-2-3-beta-release), which drastically overhauls GameMaker as we know it. This includes a major change to the way scripts work, which is inherently important to plugin utilities like those in GM Core.

The 2.3 beta is currently in a closed roll-out and acts as an entirely separate program rather than as an update for the existing mainline GameMaker application.

The stance of GM Core is to be thoughtful about the upcoming changes without making any major changes to the GM Core codebase until 2.3 is officially released out of beta.

For now, [gdash releases](https://github.com/gm-core/gdash/releases) will include a GM 2.3 beta package on release 5.0.0 and up as an additional asset. After GameMaker Studio 2.3 releases, GM Core plugins will focus primarily on 2.3 and up, but critical bug fixes and support will remain for pre-2.3 GameMaker Studio 2.
