GM Core Foundation is the fastest way to go from zero to productive in GameMaker: Studio 2.3. With one package import containing all of the goodness of GM Core, you can get up and running with a comfortable and capable foundation with minimal overhead - just some scripts and one object.

## Usage

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gm-core/foundation/releases) and import the .yymps file into your project. Alternatively, you can clone this repository and use the project itself as a starting point.
